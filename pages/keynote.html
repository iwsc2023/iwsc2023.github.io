      <h3>Large scale clone detection, analysis and benchmarking: an evolutionary perspective</h3>
    </div>
    Copying a code fragment and then reusing it by pasting and adapting (e.g., adding/modifying/deleting statements)
    is a common practice in software development, resulted in a significant amount of duplicated code in software systems.
    Developers consider cloning as one of the principled reengineering approaches and often intentionally practice
    cloning for a variety of reasons such as faster development, avoiding risk by reusing stable old code, or for
    time pressure. On the other hand, duplicated code poses a number of threats to the maintenance of software
    systems such as clones are the #1 "bad smell" in Fowler's refactoring list and there are several recent studies
    including studies with industrial systems show that although for many cases clones are not really harmful,
    and even could be useful in many cases, they could be also detrimental to software maintenance. For example,
    reusing a fragment containing unknown bugs may result in bugs propagation, or any changes in requirements
    involving a cloned fragment may lead to changes to all the similar fragments to it, multiplying the work to
    be done. Furthermore, inconsistent changes to the cloned fragments during any updating processes may lead
    to severe unexpected behaviour. Software clones are thus considered to be one of the major contributors to
    the high software maintenance cost, which could be up to 80% of total software development cost. The  era
    of  Big  Data  has  introduced  new  applications  for clone  detection.  For  example,  clone  detection
    has been  used  to  find  similar  mobile  applications,  to  intelligently  tag  code  snippets,  to
    identify  code  examples, and  so  on from large inter-project repositories.  The  dual  role  of  clones
    in  software  development and maintenance, along with these many emerging new applications  of  clone
    detection,  has  led  to  a  great  many clone  detection  tools and analysis frameworks. In this keynote
    talk, I will review the cloning literature to date, in particular, I will talk about our recent work on
    large scale clone detection, and the challenges in evaluating such clone detectors and how we have overcome
    them at least in part with our BigCloneBench and Mutation framework. I will then talk about the recent
    advances in clone analysis and management along with a vision for a comprehensive clone management system.
